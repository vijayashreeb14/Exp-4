# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## AIM:
To design UML diagrams for a Hospital Management System to model its structure and functionality.

## SRS (Procedure):
1. Class Diagram

Identify classes with attributes and methods.

Define relationships (association, generalization, aggregation).

Use class boxes and connectors.

2. Use Case Diagram

Identify actors and use cases.

Draw actors outside, use cases inside the system boundary.

Connect actors to use cases; use <>, <> if needed.

3. Activity Diagram

Identify activities, decisions, start and end nodes.

Use flow arrows, decision diamonds, and activity boxes.

Represent process flow clearly.

4. Package Diagram

Group related classes into packages.

Draw packages using folder-like symbols.

Show dependencies between packages with dashed arrows.

5. Sequence Diagram
Identify objects and message sequence.

Draw lifelines vertically.

Use horizontal arrows for messages (in order from top to bottom).

Show activation bars if needed.

6. Communication Diagram
   
Identify objects and interactions.

Represent objects as boxes connected by lines.

Label messages with sequence numbers and direction arrows.
